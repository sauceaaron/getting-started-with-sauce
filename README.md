Getting Started with Sauce Labs
===============================

This sample project will show you how to get started using Sauce Labs
by creating a simple Selenium test using Java, Maven, & TestNG.

We start off by writing and running our test against a local Selenium server.
By changing the URL and capabilities, you will be able to run it remotely using Sauce Labs infrastructure.
Because Sauce Labs has a wide variety of browsers, operating systems, and devices to run tests on, I'll show how to get the specific capabilities you want using our Platform Configurator.
Then I'll introduce some Sauce Labs specific capabilities to help you analyse test results.
Specifically, how to set your test name, build tag, and test result status in Sauce Labs.
Finally, I'll talk about some considerations for running your tests remotely and in parallel.
